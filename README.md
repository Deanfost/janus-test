# janus-test

This branch is modified to work on the Vacillate VM provisioned for the Decidio team. It uses SSL termination on WSS by virtue of the node-http-proxy. All services but Janus use a self-signed SSL certificate. **The Janus instance is not configured to refuse HTTP or normal WS requests/connections. However all requests made by the client and express server should go through the proxy.**

A test app for the Janus WebRTC server. Contains a Fedora dockerfile for a Janus container, and a simple express api server. In addition, original source code for reunitus react app taken from 
https://github.com/agonza1/reunitus.

The purpose of this project is to serve as a proof of concept for how communication works with clients between Janus and clients, and how a server might make a call to Janus using the barebones HTTP API.

## Setup 
Run <code>npm install</code> in the reunitus and express projects.

## Startup
Build and start the docker image by using <code>docker compose up</code> in the janus directory. Start the react dev server and express server with <code>npm start</code>. 

The react app is hosted on <code>localhost:3000</code>. The express server is hosted on <code>localhost:3001</code>. The Janus container should now be hosted on port <code>8088</code>.
